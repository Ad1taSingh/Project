1. No relation between top countries producing highest number of movies vs top countries having highest average IMDB ratings
   basically, this leads to a conclusion that "quantity doesn't mean quality"

2. "Medium Length duration" movies(90mins-150mins) are produced the most and are the second highest rated duration

3. "Documentaries" is the second highest rated genre and the fourth most produced genre

In conclusion we can safely say that a movie which is of "medium length duration" i.e., 90mins-150mins and has genre "Documentaries"
has the highest chance of becoming a "superhit"
Also producing more movies will not lead to more "hit" movies.
